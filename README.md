# Initiative-Tracker
Class Project - RPG Initiative Tracker

For this class project, I've decided to make an initiative tracker for pen and paper RPGs.
I want to make something simple, and mobile friendly.

I've decided to use Bootstrap as well as jQuery for this project, so I can become more
familiar with both. I'm also using command for my git commands instead of the GitHub
desktop app
